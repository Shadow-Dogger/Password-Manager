# Password-Manager
Local interpreter based password manager, meant to be carried around on a usb stick


In the future I expect this project to be include a fully function gui offering a lot more flexibility and even adding to the realisticness of its use.


V 0.1.0 of this Password Manager was the fully console version named for the whole thing, I've decided to rename it as background.py as I will be making 3 more files, another one named foreground which will contain off all the gui code, a dependencies file containing all of the dependencies and finally the build file which I hope running will package everything together in one neat little program
